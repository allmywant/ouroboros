# Ouroboros Sass/CSS Spinner

See blog entry at [http://atomeye.com/projects/sass-css-spinner.html](http://atomeye.com/projects/sass-css-spinner.html) for more details.

The Ouroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. Inspired by application progress spinners this provides an imageless 'throbber' for modern browsers that eats itself (in a way).

## Browser Support

- Chrome 24+
- Firefox 18+
- IE 10+
- Opera 12+
- Safari 5+
- iOS 5 &amp; 6 (scrolling pauses animation)

A standard 32x32 animated gif throbber is provided as a fallback for older versions of IE. It is centered where the spinner animation would have been.

## Usage

1. For Sass users add the `_ui-spinner.scss` into your project.
2. If you want IE < 10 support also add the `spinner-old-ie.scss` and the throbber.gif. You can include it with an IE conditional tag. See the example in `index.html`.

        <!--[if IE]><link media="screen" type="text/css" href="stylesheets/spinner-old-ie.css" rel="stylesheet" /><![endif]-->

3. In our project Sass use the `ui-spinner` mixin with defaults or pass in any arguments. Also see the mixin examples in `example.scss`.

        @include ui-spinner; // Will use defaults.
        @include ui-spinner(#fff, 60px, gray, purple, .7, 4s); // Will use these variables.

4. Use with the following HTML. Also see the HTML examples in `index.html`.

        <div class="ui-spinner">
            <span class="side side-left">
                <span class="fill"></span>
            </span>
            <span class="side side-right">
                <span class="fill"></span>
            </span>
        </div>



### The 6 Optional Parameters

| Parameter      | Description           | Defaults |
| ------------- |-------------| ----- |
| Hole color*      | Color of the hole to fake a ring | transparent |
| Size      | Size of the spinner      |   46px |
| Background color light | First color, specify a lighter of the two colors      |    #ddd |
| Background color dark | Second color, specify the darker of the two colors      |    #3c76ca |
| Opacity | The opacity of the spinner      |    .8 |
| Duration | Speed of the spinner     |   3s |

*The hole color is just to fake a ring spinner. You have to match the color you pass into the mixin to the background-color that the spinner will appear against.


## Don't Use Sass?

You can use the CSS that the Sass generates in `stylesheets/main.scss` and make edits to the parameters described above.
